# arvel-ecommerce-kit

An arvel application.

## Run

```
uv sync
arvel migrate          # create the database tables (sqlite by default)
arvel db:seed          # seed a demo user
arvel serve            # dev server (granian) — http://127.0.0.1:8000
arvel serve --reload   # auto-reload on code changes
```

## Structure

```
bootstrap/app.py        configure + build the app (routing, providers, middlewares, config)
bootstrap/providers.py  your app's service providers
bootstrap/middlewares.py customize the HTTP middlewares stack
config/                 configuration files, loaded into config("...")
routes/web.py           stateful browser routes (the "web" group)
routes/api.py           stateless JSON routes (the "api" group, served under /api)
routes/console.py       CLI command definitions
config/openapi.py       API docs config (title, UI, auth) — see below
app/models, app/controllers, app/providers
database/migrations, database/seeders
```

## API docs (OpenAPI)

With the server running, the interactive API docs are at **http://127.0.0.1:8000/schema** (the raw
document at `/schema/openapi.json`). Type a route's request/response with `arvel.Schema` and its schema
is generated automatically; configure the title, UI, and auth in `config/openapi.py`.

## Commands

```
source .venv/bin/activate
arvel route:list   # show registered routes
arvel shell        # interactive REPL (models + app autoloaded)
arvel make:model   # scaffold a model
```
